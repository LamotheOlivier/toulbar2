toolbar is a generic solver for WCSP, Max-SAT, and Bayesian Networks. It is a free software under GNU/GPL license. toulbar2 is a new C++ version that includes most algorithms of toolbar, some new ones, the ability to work in collaboration with ILOG Solver, and to deal with big (thousands of variables and/or large domains) problems. A reference to what a WCSP is, and what the algorithms inside toolbar are can be found in:
